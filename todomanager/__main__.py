This program is supposed to be a web api for managing my tasks in
my NextCloud instance. Especially the ones, I use for planning my
week. It is supposed to get data via POST, interprete them and work
with them then - e.g. creating tasks, modifying existing ones or
outputting tasks as markdown or so.
