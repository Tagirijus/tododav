## [0.0.16] - 2025-04-21
### Changed
- Splitted `TodoRepository.init_with_caldav()` into `TodoRepository.connect_calendar()` and `TodoRepository.populate_from_todo_list()`, which now has a default parameter and will (wÃ­thout one given) populate form the online todos, otherwise from the given list.


## [0.0.15] - 2025-04-21
### Changed

## [0.0.14] - 2025-04-20
### Changed
- I changed the filter logic of the TodoRepository.filter_by_daterange() to filter the start with the logic `>=` and the end with the logic `<`.
